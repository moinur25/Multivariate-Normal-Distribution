# Multivariate-Normal-Distribution
The multivariate normal (MVN) distribution is a generalization of the univariate normal (Gaussian) distribution to multiple dimensions. It describes the behavior of a set of random variables that may be correlated with each other while each variable individually follows a normal distribution. This distribution is widely used in statistics, machine learning, finance, and various scientific fields.
